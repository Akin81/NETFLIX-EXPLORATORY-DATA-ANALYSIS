# NETFLIX-EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS


I got Netflix dataset from Kaggle.com, imported using pandas library and took the following steps:

•	I checked the dataset descriptions, information, and missing values

•	I dropped the null(missing) values

•	Checked and dropped duplicated values

•	Sort and filter the dataset to extract meaningful and decision-making information
